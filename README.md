# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this exercise, we learned how to utilize both JavaScript and HTML to create a webpage and display data in a clean and organized fashion. By utilizing both JavaScript and HTML, we were able to transpose data from one file into a table online. In addition to displaying the table on a webpage, we wrote the code that allowed the web user to filter through the data basesd on: date 📅, city 🏙️, state 🏖️, country 🏳️, and shape 🟢. This was all in an effort to asssist Dana with her UFO sightings project 🌑.

### Results
After going through both the module and the challenge, Dana was able to present a clean and visually appealing webpage. The webpage had a creative header and an article above the filtered data table.

In order to help Dana create a search for the UFO data, we imported the data into a file titled apps.js and then created a variable (filters) for all of our filters. The next step was to create filter IDs based on the assigned elements that we planned to filter through on our HTML file. Finally, we used a "foreach" statement to loop through the data.

This allowed us to create the following filtered table on the HTML page:

### Summary
This module and challenge covered quite a few topics including JavaScript, HTML, and how the two work together. With the d3 command, you're able to make data come to life via HTML and the JavaScript syntax. This particular project was a little complex because it also included adding an interactive tool: the filter. This is something we utilize every day as consumers, and it was interesting to see how the backend works.
