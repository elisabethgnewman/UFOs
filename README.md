## Overview of Project
In this exercise, we learned how to utilize both JavaScript and HTML to create a webpage and display data in a clean and organized fashion. By utilizing both JavaScript and HTML, we were able to transpose data from one file into a table online. In addition to displaying the table on a webpage, we wrote the code that allowed the web user to filter through the data basesd on: date 📅, city 🏙️, state 🏖️, country 🏳️, and shape 🟢. 

### Results
After going through both the module and the challenge, Dana was able to present a clean and visually appealing webpage. The webpage had a creative header and an article above the filtered data table.

In order to create a search, we needed to create code that went through the data using a loop statement. 

*let changedElement = d3.select(this);
  console.log(changedElement)
  let elementValue = changedElement.property("value");
  console.log(elementValue);
  let filterId = changedElement.attr("id");
  console.log(filterId)*
